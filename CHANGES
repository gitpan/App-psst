commit 8e33e45f2124d7138c22dc6319a57abb22aa9e6a
Author: Matthew Astley <beeep$mca@t8o.org>
Date:   Fri Dec 2 09:16:37 2011 +0000

    try harder for pidseq on busy systems
    
    will skip if they're still not smoking green

commit e05d35653c77eb76596f044f28b0af5f0c4ee12c
Author: Matthew Astley <beeep$mca@t8o.org>
Date:   Fri Dec 2 09:06:27 2011 +0000

    give up earlier if no Bash.
    
    (would prefer an NA for mswin32, rather than a big red FAIL,
     this probably not enough?)
    improve version display - some smoke fails on the ([0-9.}) match;
    run preconds even without bash, they may be useful;
    remaining tests need bash to work

commit 890f273d01014e03d47f3b59c2f6c429bf3f565e
Author: Matthew Astley <beeep$mca@t8o.org>
Date:   Fri Dec 2 09:03:12 2011 +0000

    bump Time::HiRes dep to current
    
    previous min version was set for ualarm, now using alarm;
    seeing breakage on the smoketests (thank you!)
     for various Un*ces, mostly Perl 5.8.9, all Time::HiRes 1.9715
     where the alarm doesn't fire

v0.08 2011-11-23
----------------

commit f8fa59a476337d69a136c58e7216c06ae8b59bc0
Author: Syohei YOSHIDA <syohex@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed Nov 23 09:57:03 2011 +0900

    Fix checking bash version.
      - use $BASH_VERSION environment variable instead of '--version' option,
        because output of '--version' depends on locale.
    
        Regexp 'qr{\bbash\b.* version (.*)})' may not match '--version' output
        on not English locale, if latest bash is installed on it.

v0.06 2011-11-21
----------------

commit 48ae3f697625d765a6e1fd11558b0d09daaa3bd2
Author: Matthew Astley <beeep$mca@t8o.org>
Date:   Mon Nov 21 00:01:21 2011 +0000

    remove "see the other code path" breakage

commit 23ac21bb27a008f59a0b44d2fe1c80f03abc9e9c
Author: Matthew Astley <beeep$mca@t8o.org>
Date:   Sun Nov 20 23:51:26 2011 +0000

    degrade to CORE::alarm
     when Time::HiRes::alarm is not implemented

commit 22840ca52060e9f572d116caf53dd88a31e33e6f
Author: Matthew Astley <beeep$mca@t8o.org>
Date:   Sun Nov 20 23:50:40 2011 +0000

    decrease Un*x assumption: path_sep not always :
    
    use $Config{path_sep}, as local::lib does

commit 55660dc080a1b3addb69c01f6c71ae97b2390d04
Author: Matthew Astley <beeep$mca@t8o.org>
Date:   Sun Nov 20 23:53:06 2011 +0000

    decrease Un*x assumption: dirsep may not be /
    
    munge them so they are, for our regex

commit 7264008557eadf873ba74b1f43feb7364c47b599
Author: Matthew Astley <beeep$mca@t8o.org>
Date:   Sun Nov 20 23:13:15 2011 +0000

    when finding $HOME , fall back to getpwuid.
    
    we need it to ensure bash_interactive is not tromping user's history file,
     so would prefer to match bash's way of finding ~
     but as long as this runs on author's machine there should be no tromping anyway

commit f7aba5a32a0d189d8905f588f6da5e43728b80f9
Author: Matthew Astley <beeep$mca@t8o.org>
Date:   Sun Nov 20 23:10:42 2011 +0000

    YAML now required for testing, declare it.
    
    still optional for running, can't declare that

v0.05 2011-11-10
----------------

commit 51ae3683c36952f89e423622465a463fdd45725c
Author: Matthew Astley <beeep$mca@t8o.org>
Date:   Thu Nov 10 17:37:20 2011 +0000

    avoid ualarm.
    
    smoketesting fails where it is absent (Win32 strawberry),
     and I chose ualarm by analogy with usleep,
     not realising that Time::HiRes::alarm could do what I need,
     and I now guess that alarm($frac) is supported on win32.
    
    warn reader of the delay, although it should generally be short;
    s/ualarm/alarm/ , but still from Time::HiRes;
    check also that it didn't take too long

commit b6c116ee1a45ad040bcd3a2d233202b6012e489e
Author: Matthew Astley <beeep$mca@t8o.org>
Date:   Thu Nov 10 09:19:01 2011 +0000

    deal with lack of tty.
    
    we don't use any job control features;
    only needed for the few tests that compare
     output, most just apply regexps

commit 8d3a41da2d43bae5d0332aa5502f445b368a28df
Author: Matthew Astley <beeep$mca@t8o.org>
Date:   Thu Nov 10 00:22:43 2011 +0000

    ditch deprompt in favour of setting PS1.
    
    incidentally validate PS1 overriding config;
    I don't remember what I was thinking,
     but it can't deal with custom prompts seen in some smoketest sandpits

commit 941b5b043d8186935a0fd4a1a934e56a9bb19baf
Author: Matthew Astley <beeep$mca@t8o.org>
Date:   Thu Nov 10 00:16:21 2011 +0000

    restore Dump, it was in use

commit a4aba58447b1e9d7ebf687ce47b4d4aba2ddff30
Author: Matthew Astley <beeep$mca@t8o.org>
Date:   Thu Nov 10 00:00:59 2011 +0000

    ensure PATH, HOME & TERM in %ENV
    
    explain where they are needed;
    found when running under "env -i"

commit 699e56dfada58ecaa03edc246a409e250d5f4761
Author: Matthew Astley <beeep$mca@t8o.org>
Date:   Thu Nov 10 17:38:59 2011 +0000

    bash version: relax "modern-ish".
    
    still arbitrary, but 2.05b seen in smoketest;
    report the version
     because it is probably relevant for future problems

v0.04 2011-10-23
----------------

commit b1619cd269d15b195c94a22037b34d71ad8ba3bb
Author: Matthew Astley <beeep$mca@t8o.org>
Date:   Sun Oct 23 23:17:43 2011 +0100

    dist.ini: tidy + shove

commit 417f8fddf91fa4fcbed8f579eccf528148b1adbf
Author: Matthew Astley <beeep$mca@t8o.org>
Date:   Sun Oct 23 22:53:24 2011 +0100

    test L:L path substitution in prompt.
    
    check the configured PS1_substs works;
    clarify in pidburn;
    more deansi;
    extract fn for removal of bash-x.y$

commit bfa37ad1dd51ea910241430fb6a70dc8cf6b8f3d
Author: Matthew Astley <beeep$mca@t8o.org>
Date:   Wed Oct 19 17:41:39 2011 +0100

    start testing the Prompt String.
    
    see there are no changes until local::lib shows up
      assuming we consider $PERL_LOCAL_LIB_ROOT definitive;
    see both LL) prefix and hovering-below detail;
    improve deansi,
      option for it to tell more about what it took out,
      but no effort to let the tests pass when it does

commit 42684eaa8ddd0995e20a4bc8c5128a0de5c23f46
Author: Matthew Astley <beeep$mca@t8o.org>
Date:   Tue Oct 18 23:02:52 2011 +0100

    more ignorance.
    
    it's much quicker to
       git checkout built/master Makefile.PL
       perl Makefile.PL
       make test
    
    than to
       dzil test

commit 1db6d1744ea3d7647d8021712bfebe8950a7bca2
Author: Matthew Astley <beeep$mca@t8o.org>
Date:   Mon Oct 17 23:46:41 2011 +0100

    pidburn_tt tweaks.
    
    run in own sub / disconnect from prompt_tt;
    fix & show threshold for stats

commit 3810cf8cb16136595939ef2064b8bd7efde7acf9
Author: Matthew Astley <beeep$mca@t8o.org>
Date:   Sun Oct 16 23:03:38 2011 +0100

    switch autogenerated README in source back to POD.
    
    because preformat style was lost (in translation to markdown or rendering?)
     some L<> hyperlinks don't work, and retain L-prefix

commit a5b3484c7fb477b42927e8de6012ec22df34dde5
Author: Matthew Astley <beeep$mca@t8o.org>
Date:   Fri Oct 14 09:01:46 2011 +0100

    use [ExecDir]dir= default  for scripts.
    
    it still installs via blib/script/
      so t/* don't need to change

    butchery to reduce diffs.
    
    Remove variable parts from generated POD.
    There are better ways to do it.

    replace ReportPhase with Dist::Zilla::App::Command::dumpphases
    
    (it's quieter most of the time)

    fix up dzil edges.
    
    ignorance of failed-test builds;
    pacify perlcritic;
    add generated-to-source README
      made by [ReadmeAnyFromPod / ForSource] in dist.ini
      from App::psst

    with a heavy (author side) dependency chain
    
      cpan Dist::Zilla

Date:   Thu Oct 6 22:32:26 2011 +0100

    generate READMEs from POD.
    
    use DZP:ReadmeAnyFromPod to do the hard work;
    generate text README in the dist;
    maintain a README.html in the source, for the benefit of Github;
    fix typo & authorship
    
    Why the confusion about the author?
    I did part of the early research & implementation for this project at
    $work, but most of the polishing and learning about dzil in my own
    time.  It doesn't matter to me who "owns the copyright" while the
    software is Free.

    prefer :G:DescribeVersion over :G:NextVersion
     and :ChangelogFromGit over :ChangelogFromGit.
    
    (but this DescribeVersion can't make a
     v0.01_0123 style version number)

    switch to Dist::Zilla.
    
    replace MANIFEST* and Makefile.PL with dist.ini;
    don't expect MANIFEST.bak to appear now;
    fiddle with gather/prune/exec;
    might as well specify rt.cpan.org
    
    optional_features not supported?
    probably want the readonly git://
